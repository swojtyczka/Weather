# Weather

I created this simple app when I was bored during summer break.

This project uses Electron and [weatherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

All it stores is an array of places in `/data/settings.json`. There is no verification so some names may simply not work beacuse the API doesn't recognize them.
